      <h2>Türkiye’s defense sector emerges as key in Europe’s rearming</h2>
      <p>Amid rising geopolitical tensions that are reshaping security priorities in Europe and beyond, Türkiye's defense industry is seizing the moment to become a pivotal force, expanding its global footprint with record exports and landmark partnerships.</p> /n
      <p>From the war in Ukraine to uncertainty over the long-term US military presence in Europe, the continent is undergoing a profound strategic transformation.

Amid this shift, Ankara's growing defense sector is gaining global traction, increasingly positioning itself as a sought-after international supplier.</p>
      <p>Türkiye's defense exports have skyrocketed accordingly, rising from $2.3 billion in 2020 to more than $7.1 billion in 2024, according to the Turkish Defense and Aerospace Industry Manufacturers Association.

A March report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) ranked Türkiye as the world's 11th largest arms exporter, with its share of global exports more than doubling from 0.8% in 2015-2019 to 1.7% in 2020-2024.</p>
